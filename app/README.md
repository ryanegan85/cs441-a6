Assignment 6 for CS441.

This program is a framework for the next assignment, which will be a full game as described in the
"how to play" section of this program.

The first activity (MainActivity) is a splash screen with several buttons that lead to all the other
activities in the program. The first, "PLAY", leads to GameActivity, which will contain the game
created in the next assignment. The "HOW TO PLAY" button leads to an activity with an HTML display
of a short description of the game, along with instructions. The "HI-SCORES" button leads to a view
of the current stored hi-scores.

Libraries Used:
The Glide library is used to display a GIF for the game title.
